HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. A protocol for how browsers should communicate.

URL is Uniform Resource Locator. An address used to locate a resource on the internet.

DNS servers are where all IP addresses are stored. It translates host names into IP addresses.

Query String is how you can search for items or how you ask for information from server.

Two HTTP verbs are GET and POST. GET is used to only get information from server whereas POST can also make changes on the server.

HTTP request is when we ask for something from a server. 

HTTP response is when we receive a response back from server.

HTTP headers contains more information about the request to server or a response from server.
Some request headers are Scheme, Cookie, Accept, etc
Some response headers are cache-control, server, expires, etc.

When we type "http://somesite.com/some/page.html" into a browser, the browser converts the domain to an IP address and sends out a request to the server. Server then sends back a response and the browser creates the required coding to view that page.
